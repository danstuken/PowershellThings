This is just a set of files that contain functions to make doing stuff in powershell that bit easier.

To make use of any of the scripts, edit the powershell profile file (see value of $profile) thus:
. 'C:\path\to\the\ps1fileiwant.ps1'

There is a simple install/install.ps1 script included.

*WARNING*
the install script comes with no warranty. If it eats your
firstborn and runs off with your tv, that's not my fault!

The install will create a DanstukenPS folder next to your
powershell profile script and copy in the files it finds
in the src folder. It will add "sourcing" entries into
the profile script for each script it installs.
